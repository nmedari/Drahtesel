This morning I had a bratwrust for breakfast.
Then I decided to drive to Berlin for the day.
My hund bit me in the biergarten.
Then, I ran over Rammstein on the Hauptstrasse.
Had to replace my Porsche with a new BMW.
Drove to play wettbewerbsfaehig hockey at the Schloss.
My dirndl got dirty because I tripped onto a doener stand, so I changed into my lederhose. 
Then I went to the grocery store and bought some brot.
Then I went to the Flughafen and booked a flight to Raesfeld.
Only once I got home did I realize I forgot the Apfelkuchen.
But the ratskeller down the road had some leftover apfelkuchen.
I went to a flughafen.
I really wanted to fly to a schloss across the country.
I felt like standing in front of a klimaanlage.
While enjoying the cool breeze I began to have second thoughts about selling my Porsche.
I thought to myself I should of never bought a car in the first place since I will now not be able to buy Eltz Castle.
